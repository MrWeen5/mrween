# About me

### 👋 Hi, I'm MrWeen.

- ✏️ I am currently working on a FiveM server
- 🌱 I am currently learning Java
- 🤍 I am a medical student and in my spare time a space lover
- 🐇 My pet is a bunny named Coco

### 📜 Goals for 2023

I want to make a FiveM server this year. I would like to learn a little more about flutter, java and also complement my knowledge in lua. It is very easy to design a fivem server but all the infrastructure that comes behind it is not easy but I was excited to solve this challenge.
